# Spoiler Alert Installation

If I wanted this to be a proper extension, I'd have to pay Google $5. I don't really want to do that, so if you're okay with a bit of "hacking", then the following steps will install the extension on your Chrome (or Chromium based) browser.

## 1. Download the code

At the top of this page, you should find a green button `Code`, on the right side of the page:

From the popup that appears, select `Download ZIP` at the bottom:

## 2. Extract the ZIP

Find the downloaded ZIP file and extract the files to a folder. This folder can be anywhere on your PC, as long as it's extracted, and not left in its ZIP format.

## 3. Install it in Chrome

In the top right corner of Chrome, you'll find three vertical dots. Click that and find `Extensions` and then `Manage Extensions`:

This opens the `chrome://extensions/` page.

In the top right of that page, you will see a toggle `Developer Mode`:

This will show you some special buttons in the top left.

The `Load unpacked` is the button we need - click that, and navigate to the folder you extracted the ZIP to. You don't need to select a file (Chrome will find the files it needs).

Once done you should see this somewhere on the page (or something similar):

## 4. See it in action

Navigate to any of the supported websites:

You'll see the page go blank for a second while the scripts remove all the thumbnails, then it will come back and everything will be hidden.
